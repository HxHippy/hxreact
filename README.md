## Troubleshooting

- **Version Conflicts**: If you encounter dependency conflicts, ensure you're using compatible versions of Node.js and npm. The script attempts to install the latest versions, but some libraries may have peer dependency requirements.
- **Permission Issues**: If you face permission errors, try running the script with `sudo`, but it's generally better to adjust your user permissions.
- **Missing Global Packages**: Ensure that `npx` and `git` are installed and available in your PATH.
